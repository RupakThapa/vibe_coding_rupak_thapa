    <div class="story-content">
      <p class="lead-text">I didn't start as a designer who "just makes things look good."</p>
      <p>I started as someone curious about how systems behave, how people think, and why tools either empower or frustrate us.</p>
      <p>With a foundation in computer science and over four years of professional design experience, I now work at the intersection of UX, AI, and product thinking. Today, as a Master's student in User Experience Design in Germany, I explore how emerging AI tools can reduce friction, eliminate repetitive work, and create more human-centered digital products.</p>
