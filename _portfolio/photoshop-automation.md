Custom AI-powered extensions for designers.

I built Photoshop extensions that automate repetitive design tasks, helping designers focus on creative decisions instead of manual execution. This project reflects my belief that AI should remove friction, not replace creativity.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Design productivity**
- **AI-assisted workflows**
- **Tooling for designers**
