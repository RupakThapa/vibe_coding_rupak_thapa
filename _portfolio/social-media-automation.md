An end-to-end platform for automated caption generation.

This project focused on reducing repetitive marketing work using generative AI. I designed the UX, logic flow, and prompt systems that allow users to generate consistent, brand-aligned social media content at scale.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Prompt engineering frameworks**
- **Scalable UX flows**
- **Automation without loss of voice**
